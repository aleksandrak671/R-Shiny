## About This Project

This project was created as part of a university course **Programowanie w R (N24)**.  

**Goal:**  
- Use lesser-known, publicly available data  
- Document the analysis in **RMarkdown** with:
  - Details about the dataset
  - Explanation of analytical methods
  - Results with rich formatting (plots, code, tables, text)  
- Develop an **R Shiny app** to allow interactive data exploration

---

## Dataset

- **Topic:** Plastic waste around the world
- **Source:** [Global Plastic Waste 2023 ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/global-plastic-waste-2023-a-country-wise-analysis)
- **Features include:**
  - Country-level statistics
  - Plastic waste generation (kg/person/year)
  - Mismanaged waste
  - Recycling rates

---

## Methodology

The analysis uses:  
- **Data cleaning & transformation in R**  
- **Descriptive statistics**  
- **Visualizations:** bar plots, tables, interactive filtering  
- **Interactivity:** filter by country, compare indicators  

---

## Results

The project addresses:  
- Countries with highest plastic waste per capita  
- Rates of mismanaged waste  
- Comparisons of recycling efficiency  

Results are shown in both **RMarkdown** documents and this **interactive Shiny app**, making the findings accessible to any user.

---

## App Functionality

The deployed Shiny app allows you to:
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Explore plastic waste indicators interactively
- View dynamic plots and summary tables
- Intuitively compare country-level differences
